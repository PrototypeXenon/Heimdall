                A computer virus is a small piece of software that can spread from one infected computer to another. The virus could corrupt, steal, or delete data on your computerï¿½even erasing everything on your hard drive. A virus could also use other programs, like your email program, to spread itself to other computers. <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
