                A computer virus is a small piece of software that can spread from one infected computer to another. The virus could corrupt, steal, or delete data on your computer, even erasing everything on your hard drive. A virus could also use other programs, like your email program, to spread itself to other computers. They come in many shapes and forms all slightly diffrent and harder to spot so keep a sharp eye out for things that seem out of place. For example, when there is progams that you have not touch in over a year and all of a sudden it opens up and runs like you would any other app/program or your computer gets restarted when you never authorized it to restart. <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
