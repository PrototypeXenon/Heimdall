                Apps are a relatively a new threat, but still can be as dangerous as any other virus that you can get on any device. People tend to trust apps from big companies like iTunes and Google Play, but these apps can still carry viruses, which can harm your computer or mobile device and reveal your personal information to outside sources.  <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
