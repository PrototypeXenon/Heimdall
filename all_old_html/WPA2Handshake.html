                The Key reinstallation attack (or Krack) vulnerability allows a malicious actor to read encrypted network traffic on a Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) router and send traffic back to the network. Krack can affect both personal (home users, and small businesses) and enterprise networks. Any devices that are connected to the network, such as laptops, smartphones, smart devices, even an installed USB key, can be read by the attacker. A malicious actor could use this vulnerability to steal sensitive information, and also insert malware or ransomware that would make a website unsafe to visit. Krack does not divulge Wi-Fi passwords to attackers, nor does it permit a malicious device to be connected to the network. Krack is unable to compromise Virtual Private Networks (VPN) or HTTPS protocols used by online shopping and banking sites.  <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
