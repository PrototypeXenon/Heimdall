             Don't reply to bullies because that may be seen as a sign that you are weak. Don't try to solve the problems on your own, but ask an adult for help to solve the problem. 
             Don't delete the messages so they can be used for evidence just in case the situation escelates

                Cyberbullying is a huge problem today and it's best to just ignore cyberbullies and report them to the authorities or a trusted adult. In most cases, cyberbullying doesn't elevate to a higher level unless the recipient responds and/or argues with the bully. In most cases, the bullies are simply trying to solicit a response and ignoring them will make them leave the recipient alone. <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
