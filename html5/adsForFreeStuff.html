                If you ever get a pop up that says "YOU WIN" or "CLICK HERE FOR FREE MINECRAFT" the majority of the time this is a tactic to get private information out of you, or to get bugs onto your computer. Do not trust these sites or advertisements. If you are on a website that is asking for things that aren't essential, like your credit card number when you aren't purchasing something, be frugal with the informaion you give them! <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
