            <p id="longExplaination"> Even sites which are known to be safe could hold threats in the form of unsafe advertisements. Be careful which advertisements you click on, as not all of them are secure! Be sure that you haven't stumbled across a "copy site". They look like the original, but instead hold infectious malware or examples of phishing. A safe site will always be secured with "http://" or "https://".<!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
