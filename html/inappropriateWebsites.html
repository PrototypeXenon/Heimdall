                If you stumble upon a website containing sexual or graphic content, exit the page. If you try to return to the website, you are putting yourself and your computer at risk of accessing malware. If you do visit an inappropriate website by any chance, make sure you check your computer and files immediately for any infection, such as a malware or virus that may have been downloaded onto your computer without your knowledge.
