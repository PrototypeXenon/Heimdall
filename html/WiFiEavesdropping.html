                WiFi eavesdropping is another method used by cyber criminals to capture personal information. It is like virtual "listening in" on information that's shared over a non encrypted WiFi network. When using wifi that may be provided by public places, such as restaurants, don't open up your emails, bank acccounts, or any other personal apps, so that if there is a criminal that is wifi eavesdropping, you are not at risk of getting your identity stolen. <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
