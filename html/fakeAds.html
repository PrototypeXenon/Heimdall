                Advertisements are everywhere on almost every website, aplication, on your computers, and on your phone. These advertisements will advertise everything from children's toys to new movies to video games. These ads however are not as innocent as they may seem. Some ads are put onto websites to put viruses on your computer or smart phone or to take your personal information. Avoid clicking on advertisements on websites. If you are interested in what the advertisement advertises, then go look it up and find it manually, without clicking the advertisement. If you can't seem to find the product that was being advertised, chances are it was a fake ad. However, even if you can find the product being advertised, sometimes it will ask you for information that doesn't make sense, like your credit card number to watch a free movie. Don't trust these websites. Other times you might get a pop-up that says to you "YOU WON CLICK HERE TO CLAIM YOUR PRIZE!" don't click on it because the only prize you will be getting is malware and the only person who won was the criminal who just managed to put a virus on your pc.
