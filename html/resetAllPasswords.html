                Before getting deleted, malware could have captured passwords and revealed them to others. Change each and every password you can think of, so that there is a smaller chance of getting hacked. It is recommended that passwords should be at least eight characters with at least one number, and possibly even a symbol, if it is possible. Doing this may help prevent from future attacks and hacks on your account(s).
