                A Botnet is a collection of software robots, or bots, that run automated tasks over the Internet. Your computer could be used in this "botnet army" without you even knowing. These "zombies" typically run programs such as worms, Trojan horses, or backdoors. Botnets are frequently used to launch Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks against websites. Newer bots can automatically scan their environment and propagate themselves using vulnerabilities and weak passwords. Experts estimate that as many as one in four personal computers connected to the Internet have become part of a botnet.
