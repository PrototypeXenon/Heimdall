               There are websites that may appear to be real, but all they want is for you to visit their website so they can steal your private information. They can do this in various ways, such as: spreading malware on your computer, or asking for personal information, such as credit/debit card numbers, as well as passwords or usernames if the original website requires it in order to view the information on it.   There are also websites designed simply to give out false information. Check the website thoroughly and look up examples of real and fake websites to help figure out whether the website you are visiting is legit, and whether the information you are visiting is accurate.
