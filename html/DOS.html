                A Denial-of-Service or DoS attack is an attempt to make a computer resource, such as a website or web service, unavailable to users. One of the most common methods of attack involves saturating the target (victim) machine with external communications requests. The machine then cannot respond to legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly as to be rendered effectively unavailable. Attacks are often launched by networks of zombie computers or botnets. These are known as Distributed Denial-of-Service or DDoS attacks. <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
