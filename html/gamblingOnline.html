               Gambling is legally restricted by state, and is illegal for all minors. Online gambling has no restrictions on who can gamble, and may put you at risk of getting your credit card number stolen, as well as the possibility of getting other personal information taken from you in the process. Many gambling sites will be scammed, and to help prevent this, use the C.R.A.P.P method: C= currency R=reliability A=authortiy P=purpose P= point of view. This is an easy abbreviation to remember, and is a useful way to help keep you safe if you do gamble online (legally, of course).
