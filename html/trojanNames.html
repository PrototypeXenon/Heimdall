                A Trojan Horse is a malicious program that is disguised as, or embedded within, legitimate software. It is an executable file that will install itself and run automatically once it's downloaded. Be careful when running .exe files, and be absolutely sure it's from a trusted source. Make sure to regularly check your downloaded files, and if you see a Trojan Horse installed on your computer, get rid of it immediately by deleting any file that may have been affected, which may include anything that has your personal information, as well as pictures.
