                Try to steer clear of sites that may ask you for bank account information. Don't ever give away credit or debit card numbers, or any other bank account information that may be used to steal your identity, to sources that aren't fully trusted. Make sure you keep in mind how to identify a real and fake website or source, and look for those signs before giving any bank account information to prevent theft and the trouble of getting a new card.
