                Don't post anything you wouldn't want a certain person or group to see, because there is always a way to find it. Some companies may go through your social media during the hiring process, and if the company finds anything on your accounts that could be considered inappropriate, you may not get the job. Be cautious when making posts, and make sure to use common sense before posting something. <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
