                Phishing scams are fraudulent attempts by cybercriminals to obtain private information. Phishing scams often appear in the guise of email messages designed to appear as though they are from legitimate sources. For example, an email could try to lure you into giving your personal information by pretending that your bank or email service provider is updating its website, and that you must click on the link in the email to verify your account information and password details.
