                Apps are a relatively a new threat, but are as dangerous as any other virus that you can get on any device. People tend to trust apps from big companies, such as iTunes and Google Play, but these apps still have the ability to carry viruses or malware, that can harm your computer or mobile device, and reveal your personal information to outside sources. This information can also be stolen from the app developer or the app itself and can be used for the app's or developer's own benefit.
