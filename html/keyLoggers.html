                A keylogger is a software program that is installed on a computer, often by a Trojan Horse or virus. Keyloggers capture and record user keystrokes. The data captured is then transmitted to a remote computer. This may or may not directly affect your computer, but it can be a method used to get passwords and other personal information. If you have any suspicion of keyloggers being used on your computer, make sure you check your computer and files for possible infection, delete the software, and change all passwords and any other personal information that may be used to hack your accounts.
