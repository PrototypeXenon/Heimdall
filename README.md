# securityAPP

securityAPP is a website (with a temporary name) which was created to help make the internet a safer place for everyone. Our team's intention is to create a visually pleasing, easy-to-use website with complete, but human-understanable guides for staying safe. We want to create a community of like-minded guardians of the internet. securityApp is the solution to the growing problem of internet safety.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

##### What things you need to install the software and how to install them

Currently, securityApp only needs javascript, HTML, and CSS, all of which come pre-installed with most operating systems. If you're using an OS that doesn't have these installed by default, you probably know how to install them yourself.

### Code Styling

To be honest, we don't really have a uniform style yet. Stay tuned for that OR [contribute one!](https://github.com/PrototypeXenon/securityApp/issues/1)

```
Example code will go here someday
```

## Deployment

securityApp is meant to run on my Apache server, which it does!
