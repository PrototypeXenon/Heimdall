                Popups warning you of malicious software on your computer, can actually be software that downloads malicious onto your computer. These popups appear legitimate and ask you to click on a link to install the "update", or "remove" unwanted malicious software that they may have  detected. This could be rogue security software, designed to lure people into clicking and downloading malicious software. It may appear as a pop up that states your computer is at risk, or may already have a virus, and asks you to click a link to allow it to "fix" the problem.  In all reality, you are just letting them access your computer remotely, and the software has a better chance of stealing your personal information.  <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
