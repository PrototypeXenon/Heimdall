                Popups warning you of malicious software on your computer are sometimes software to do the exact opposite of what it says. It appears legitimate and asks you to click on a link to install the "update" or "remove" unwanted malicious software that it has apparently detected. This could be rogue security software designed to lure people into clicking and downloading malicious software, sometimes it will be a pop up that says your computer is at risk or already has a virus and ask you to click a link to allow them to "fix" the problem but in all reality you are just letting them access your computer remotely and they will steal all your information.  <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
