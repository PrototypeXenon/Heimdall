               There are websites that may appear to be real, but all they want is for you to visit their website so they can steal your private information. They can do this in various ways. Sometimes simply opening the website can give you malware. Other times the website appears legit, but will ask for private information like your credit card number. There's also websites designed simply to give out false information. Check the website thoroughly before trusting it with your personal information and before trusting the information it is providing. <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
