                If there's an update on any of your software, make sure to install it. The most dangerous forms of malware are delivered through exploitation of out-of-date software. Take, for example, the Equifax data breach. Although these updates may seem annoying and may take time to install, it is worth spending that time to make sure your software information is safe. Also having the most up to date software on your device will have better protection against these things.     <!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->
